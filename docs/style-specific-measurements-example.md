# Style-Specific Measurements Guide

## Overview
This guide explains how to set up different measurement requirements for different product styles. For example, Style A might require 3 measurements while Style B requires 5 measurements.

## How It Works

### Style-Specific Measurements (Required)
- Each style must have its own set of measurements defined
- No product-level measurements - all measurements are style-specific
- Each style can have completely different measurement requirements
- If a style has no measurements defined, no measurements will be required

## Example Setup

### Product: Custom Cover
**Product-Level Measurements:** None (all measurements are style-specific)

### Style A: Standard Cover
**Style-Specific Measurements:**
- Length (inches)
- Width (inches)
- Height (inches)

### Style B: Custom Shape Cover
**Style-Specific Measurements:**
- Side 1 (inches)
- Side 2 (inches)
- Side 3 (inches)
- Side 4 (inches)
- Side 5 (inches)

### Style C: Round Cover
**Style-Specific Measurements:**
- Diameter (inches)
- Height (inches)

### Style D: No Measurements Required
**Style-Specific Measurements:** None (no measurements required)

## Setting Up in Sanity Studio

### Step 1: Create Product
1. Go to your product in Sanity Studio
2. **Skip the "Required Measurements" section** - it's been removed
3. All measurements are now handled at the style level

### Step 2: Add Style-Specific Measurements
1. In the "Product Variations" â†’ "Style Options" section
2. For each style:
   - Click on the style
   - Scroll to "Style-Specific Measurements"
   - Add the measurements required for that style
   - Leave empty for styles that don't need measurements

### Step 3: Configure Each Measurement
For each measurement, set:
- **Measurement ID**: Unique identifier (e.g., "side1", "diameter")
- **Measurement Name**: Display name (e.g., "Side 1", "Diameter")
- **Required**: Whether this measurement is mandatory
- **Unit**: Measurement unit (e.g., "inches", "cm")
- **Placeholder Text**: Help text for the input field
- **Input Type**: "Number" or "Text"

## Customer Experience

### Before Style Selection
- Measurement section shows a message: "Please select a style first to see required measurements"

### After Style Selection
- Measurement section dynamically updates to show only the measurements for the selected style
- Style selector shows measurement count for each style (e.g., "3 measurements required")
- Validation only checks measurements for the selected style

### Example Flow
1. Customer selects "Style B: Custom Shape Cover"
2. Measurement section shows 5 inputs: Side 1, Side 2, Side 3, Side 4, Side 5
3. Customer fills in all 5 measurements
4. Configuration is valid and ready for cart

## Benefits

1. **Clarity**: No confusion about where to add measurements
2. **Flexibility**: Different styles can have completely different measurement requirements
3. **User Experience**: Customers only see relevant measurements for their chosen style
4. **Validation**: Only validates measurements that are actually required
5. **Visual Feedback**: Style selector shows measurement count for each option

## Technical Implementation

### Frontend Changes
- `ProductConfigurator.tsx`: Filters measurements based on selected style
- `StyleSelector.tsx`: Shows measurement count for each style
- `MeasurementForm.tsx`: Dynamically renders measurement inputs

### Backend Changes
- Sanity schema: Removed product-level measurements, only style-specific
- Query updates: Only include style-specific measurements
- Type definitions: Updated to make product measurements optional

### Validation Logic
- Only validates measurements for the selected style
- No fallback to product-level measurements
- Updates validation state when style changes
